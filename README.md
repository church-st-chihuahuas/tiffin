#### Product Far Vision
The product is a key contributor to making sure that people who want work in the culinary profession can make a living doing what they love. Consumers can obtain affordable healthy meals for their families on their own terms.



#### Product Near Vision
The product is a mobile and web-based tool for building community by making trusted connections between food providers and consumers.  Affordable healthy meals are available to people who don’t have the time to make them. People can feed their families healthy food without the guilt associated with takeout and fast food.  The product also generates a revenue stream for the business owner. 


#### GitHub Repo
https://github.com/church-st-chihuahuas/tiffin

#### Rationale for Ordering PBIs
The PBIs were ordered such that we could satisfy the stakeholder's bare minimum requirements for her product vision.  In other words, the product has to, at a minimum, enable trusted connections between chefs and clients by allowing them to post and edit information about themselves, their abilities, and desires.  Then, it has to enable clients to place orders.  Then, it has to enable chefs and clients to review each other.  Then, it has to enable automated payments through the application.  Finally, it needs to enable special orders and event catering once we have demonstrated the most basic functionality.

#### Statements on Estimation:
Only development team members have participated in creating estimations for the PBIs.  We used the planning poker tool at planningpoker.com to reach consensus on the estimates.

Forecast of Velocity: 24 Story Points per Sprint

Rationale for Velocity: This is foundational work that will help us understand how fast we can go; once the infrastructure and story boards are complete, we expect velocity to increase.  The foundational work includes ensuring that clients and chefs can log in and create accounts, which is a necessary step before having them communicate and interact.

Half-velocity is 12 Story Points; all stories are less than 12 Story Points.

Evidence of sprint review with stakeholder, held between 12:45 and 1:10 on 05 July (stakeholder.png); stakeholder was pleased with progress and accepted the sprint results; dev team was updated at 2:00 pm

Forecast of Velocity: 40 Story Points per Sprint; we added another 8 Story Points mid-sprint for a total of 48

Rationale for Velocity: While Yesterday's Weather would indicate that our velocity should be 24 story points per sprint, we have overcome many of the technical hurdles we encountered during the first sprint and have established a working framework.  We therefore believe we can forecast 40 points for this sprint.

Half-velocity is 24 Story Points; all stories are less than 24 Story Points.

Forecast of Velocity: 39 Story Points per Sprint

Rationale for Velocity: Yesterday's Weather indicated we could accomplish more than we forecasted; however, we knew we could not do 48 because we did not have as much time to work during the day.

Half-velocity is 19 Story Points; all stories are less than 19 Story Points.

The CI/CD process described:

When the code is checked into the master branch in GitHub, it is immediately detected by SemaphoreCI where it is built, and tests are run. If all the tests pass, the code is then deployed to Cloud66 into the production server. We do not have tests that run between Semaphore and Cloud66 on a stage environment yet, and it's not clear how to do that with these services. We are currently exploring alternatives.
