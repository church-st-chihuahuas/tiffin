#### Rationale for Ordering PBIs
The PBIs were ordered such that we could satisfy the stakeholder's bare minimum requirements for her product vision.  In other words, the product has to, at a minimum, enable trusted connections between chefs and clients by allowing them to post and edit information about themselves, their abilities, and desires.  Then, it has to enable clients to place orders.  Then, it has to enable chefs and clients to review each other.  Then, it has to enable automated payments through the application.  Finally, it needs to enable special orders and event catering once we have demonstrated the most basic functionality.

#### Statements on Estimation:
Only development team members have participated in creating estimations for the PBIs.  We used the planning poker tool at planningpoker.com to reach consensus on the estimates.
